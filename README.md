## 🚀 Backend Setup

### Steps to Set Up the Backend Locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paolacernada/Crowd-sourced-Fitness-Challenge-App.git
   cd Crowd-sourced-Fitness-Challenge-App
   ```

2. Create a `.env.server` file at the root of the `test_backend` folder and add the `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

3. In a new terminal window, navigate to the `test_backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd test_backend
   ```

4. Install dependencies and run the backend:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   * This installs the dependencies and runs the backend.
   * **Keep this terminal open** to continue running the backend.

# ⚡ Supabase Edge Functions

### Installation

1. Install Supabase CLI, following instructions to add it to your PATH:
   ```bash
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase
   ```

2. Upgrade Supabase CLI (if needed):
   ```bash
   brew upgrade supabase
   ```

3. Log into Supabase. If you see an error (WSL may cause one), try adding the `--no-browser` flag:
   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```

4. Initialize the Supabase project in the root folder:
   ```bash
   supabase init
   ```

5. Start the Supabase service:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

# 🧪 Testing

1. Run the function locally for testing:
   ```bash
   supabase functions serve exampleFunction
   ```

2. Deploy the function to Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy functionName
   ```

   - Deployment URL can be found in the terminal output after deployment.

3. Update the frontend to use the deployed Edge Function URL instead of local routes.

## 📦 Exporting React Native App

1. In the frontend root folder, run  
   ```bash
   npx expo export
   ```

2. If there is trouble running the linter after exporting a build, run:
